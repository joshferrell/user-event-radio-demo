# React Testing Library Radio Tests

Currently radio in the user-event library does not work according to browser behavior. I've written tests in this file that I've verified to work in the browser, but the behavior does not work in react testing library when using the user-event library.

Install: `pnpm i`
To run the tests use `pnpm test`
To run a demo use `pnpm dev`
